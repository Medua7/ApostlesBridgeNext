**ApostlesBridgeNext**  
A Fabric 1.21.5 client-side mod designed for Hypixel SkyBlock. Itâ€™s an updated migration of [Medua7/ApostlesBridge](https://github.com/Medua7/ApostlesBridge), originally built for Forge 1.8.9. The mod is a bridge (using WebSocket technology) between Minecraft "Guild Chat" on Hypixel Skyblock and a Discord channel.

## Features

- Settings to configurate the mod are accessed with `/bridge`
- Modes to even access bridge messages outside of Hypixel's server
- A formatting screen to customize your bridge visuals
- Ignore lists for players and origins:
  - `/bridge ignore add player <name>`
  - `/bridge ignore remove origin <name>`
  - `/bridge ignore list`
- Other commands:
  - `/bridge reconnect` â€” Reconnects the WebSocket session
  - `/bridge status` â€” Shows the current WebSocket status
  - `/bridge help` â€” Shows command usages

_(WebSocket connection properties are found on the discord)_

## Usage
